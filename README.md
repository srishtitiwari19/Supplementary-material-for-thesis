This repository contains the lengthy results of my thesis.
FreqEvolOfEccentricity.txt - The 3PN-accurate expression for frequency evolution of orbital eccentricity, et that is accurate to next-next-to-leading-order or fifth order in initial eccentricity, e0 i.e. O(e0^5).
FourierPhase.txt - The 3PN-accurate expression for the Fourier phase with next-next-to-leading-order corrections in eccentricity i.e. incorporates upto O(e0^6) terms.
FourierPhase_with_AdvOfPeriastron.txt - The 3PN-accurate expression for the Fourier phase with the effect of periastron advance included in it. These Fourier phases are accurate upto sixth order in eccentricity i.e. O(e0^6).
